## Guide

The project is divided into two folders: report and code.

The report folder contains our overview of the project and the implementation.

In the code folder, we uploaded all the algorithms and code we used to implement this project, including cmakelist, src, include, and third-party libraries.

The compilation process can be achieved directly by compiling the files in the code directory and enjoying our simple and convenient graphical interface!
